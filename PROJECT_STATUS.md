# Målerjakt (Moth Hunt) - Project Status & Development Plan

## Project Overview

Målerjakt is a citizen science web application for tracking and identifying moths. Built with Next.js, React, and Supabase, it enables users to submit moth observations with photos and geolocation data. The app is designed to work across iOS, Android, and desktop browsers as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

**Current Status:** ~75% Complete - Functional prototype with core features working
